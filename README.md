# AccessGuru: Leveraging LLMs to Detect and Correct Web Accessibility Violations in HTML Code


## Overview

**AccessGuru** is a novel system that combines large language models (LLMs) and accessibility testing tools to **automatically detect and correct web accessibility violations** in HTML code.

üî¨ Contributions:

-  A taxonomy categorizing Web accessibility violations into **Syntactic**, **Semantic**, and **Layout** violations
-  A benchmark dataset of **3,500 real-world violations** across **112 types**
-  A modular pipeline:
  - `AccessGuruDetect`: Detect violations (Axe-Playwright + LLM)
  - `AccessGuruCorrect`: Generate corrections using LLM prompting strategies



## üìÅ Repository Structure



## üìä Dataset
- 3,500 annotated HTML violations
- 112 distinct types
- Sourced from 448 real-world web pages across domains (health, news, e-commerce, etc.)


## üì¶ Baselines 
Reproducible baseline implementations:

- **Zero-shot prompting**

Delnevo et al. "On the Interaction with Large Language Models for Web Accessibility: Implications and Challenges" (2024)
- **Contextual prompting**

 Othman et al. "Fostering websites accessibility: A case study on the use of the Large Language Models ChatGPT for automatic remediation" (2023)
- **ReAct prompting**

Huang et al. "ACCESS: Prompt Engineering for Automated Web Accessibility Violation Corrections" (2024)

## üë©‚Äçüíª Human Evaluation
This repository includes a developer study to compare LLM-generated accessibility corrections with human-written ones. We evaluated 55 semantic violations using:
- Manual expert annotations based on WCAG 2.1
- Sentence-BERT semantic similarity with developer-generated fixes

üìã You can contribute to our ongoing evaluation study by participating in a short survey and reviewing a small set of HTML accessibility corrections. 

Participate in the Evaluation Survey
(https://surveyjs.io/published?id=c2ebd794-0b9d-4af2-a4ab-79c5ddb6c509)

Your feedback will support future benchmarking and the design of more effective accessibility correction systems.
