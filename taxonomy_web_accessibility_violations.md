# Taxonomy of Web Accessibility Violations

Each violation includes a **Violation Name**, **Description**, the corresponding **WCAG Guidelines** it violates, **Impact**, and **Supplementary Information**.

- **Syntactic Violations:** These occur when HTML code lacks proper structural elements or attributes required by accessibility standards. Examples include missing alt attributes for images or improperly structured tables, which hinder compliance with accessibility guidelines. (HTML code expertise only)
- **Layout Violations:** These relate to visual design and organization that do not meet accessibility standards, such as insufficient color contrast between text and background. These issues affect readability and usability for users, especially those with visual impairments. (Familiar with web design principles, make sure it is not distorted for normal users)
- **Semantic Violations:** We define semantic violations as the violations that involve the misuse or absence of meaningful content or attributes that provide contextual understanding. For instance, using nonsensical or placeholder text in alt attributes fails to convey the intended information to assistive technologies.
